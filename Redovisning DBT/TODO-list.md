# TODO-List 
A list of things I want to implement to my portfolio, but sadly haven't had time to do just yet.

## Navbar
- Remove React-Bootstrap and Bootstrap (from code and ./node_modules)
- Replace with custom navbar implementation
    - Implement some fun hamburger icon interaction. :smile:
- Refactor my global Sass because of no longer conflict with Bootstrap
- Add Github, LinkedIn, Email links

---

## Homepage 
- Add call-to-action buttons for the case previews on the home page :exclamation:
- Add call-to-action on the "Welcome" landing case
- Add img in the cases with that gives a peek of the final product
- Add decorations:
    - Something to separate each case from the previous
- Finish Mobile-first development (mostly Sass)
    - Develop tablet and desktop specific Sass for responsiveness. 

---

## Case study page (for each project)
- Some fancy banner or something. :thought_balloon:
- Keep the same title as in the case preview from the homepage?
- List some things I did on each project. 
- List the tools I used.
    - Use some nice svg:s or icons :sparkles:
- Write about what I learned during each project.
- Show images from the process, and the final product. 

---

## About me page
- Perhaps make it similar to the case study page?
    - Could make it easier because of React modularity.
- Add an image of me?
    - Aka I first need to take and/or find some good ones first :sweat:

---

## Footer
- Add Location :pushpin:, Email :envelope: etc.
    - Add icons for those (just take some from material.io?)
- Add email functionality (so that an email could be sent directly from my site)

---

## Misc
- Make a Sass overhaul. Convert content to Grid-layout. 
    - Will make things easier later, but will require a lot of changes to 
    current margins, padding and display-layouts. 
- Decide on what colors to use for my accent colors/theme.
- Update favicon to match color theme. 
- Deploy the website to a hosting service (Github pages?)
