## William's portfolio
This is my online portfolio, built with modern web development tools such as React.js, Sass and Bootstrap. 

---


This project is currently a **Work in progress.** <br />
If you wish to run the website locally on your own computer, you need to install 
`node.js`.  I'm using version 12.16.1, so go for that version if you're unsure. 
When Node.js is installed, you can run the available scripts.


## Available Scripts

In the terminal, locate the project's root directory. <br />
From there, run one of the following commands:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you save any edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

:exclamation: This method is the easiest if you want to just take a look at the website.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
